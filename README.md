# Educational-Games-for-Kids
Our Educational Games for Kids project creates good feelings between children and animals.
It aims to teach children love for animals, to protect them, to feed them and to teach them about animals. 
While our Educational Games for Children project entertains children with games, they also instill their responsibilities towards animals and provide good reminders and information.
